// here we see the queue data struture in the c 
// what is the queue 
// queue is the linear data structure 
// queue work on the fifo -> first in first out algorithms 

//  the element added first is delated first  from the queue 


// adding an element is  know as enqueue 
// delating and element  is know as dequeue 

// two special index in the queue 
// front and rear 
// front -> is the first element in the queue 
// front point the first element in the queue 


// rear -> rear is the last element in the queue 




// enqueue take place from the rear side of the 
// dequeue take from from the front side -> bec queue work  on the fifo algorithms
