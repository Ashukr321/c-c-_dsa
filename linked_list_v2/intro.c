// why linked list  :) 

// int  *ptr = new int [5]= > this is created inside the heap memory 
// pointer ptr is created inside the stack 

// we want variables size data structure 
// so we need to used the linked list data structure 
// we must  have to create the memory  in heap during the runtime of the programme 

// we always create the linked list in the heap  memory 

// for defining the node we need two things 
// data , pointer 
// data can be any type of data
// pointer is pointing to the node of the data 

// pointer is having of its own type 

// two pointer can pointing the same node 



// how a node is created 
// for creating a node first we need a pointer  bec node is created in the heap 

// struct node *p 
// malloc function return void type of pointer so we have to typecast 

// structure member is access by the -> arrow
